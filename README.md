## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Added a filter option. So the user can search through a filter based 
      on different types of styles of food
- [x] Implemented a new protocol for the UI switch which allows the user
      to filter through different types of styles of food
Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1.  I would like to better implement the auto layout. Better constrain the objects 
2.  I would like to better implement the filter view. 

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

In the simulator when I ran it, the images of the restaurant and
ratings did not show up, but it did on my phone. It is taking a long
time to load the pictures, but it does work 
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
